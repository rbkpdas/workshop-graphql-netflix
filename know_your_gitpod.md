# Know your gitpod

Take a moment to read this entire section since it'll help you with the rest of the workshop as you'll be spending lot of your time in Gitpod. If you're familiar with Gitpod, you can easily skip this entire section.

### Appearance

The extreme left side has the explorer view(1). The top left, middle to right is where you'll be editing files(2), etc. and the bottom left, middle to right is what we will refer to as the Gitpod terminal window(3) as shown below.

### Your public URL

The workshop application has opened with an ephemeral URL.
To know the URL where your application endpoint will be exposed you can run the following command in the terminal after the build has completed.
**Please note this URL and open this up in a new browser window as shown below**.

```bash
gp url 8888
```

You can launch a new browser window and keep it open for the rest of the workshop, even in case the application is not running yet (in which case you can always refresh the tab later, after starting the app).
